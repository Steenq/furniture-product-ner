Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately.\nA Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed.\nCrafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda.\nThe timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.\nThis piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!\nCountry of Origin: India\nHardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal.

We will keep you advised of any delays that arise as the information is received.\nWe offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as \"in good condition\" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released.\nThe customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited.

     Refined elegance by PINCH | View the Yves desk\n – PINCH London\nChange country\nChoose your region\nClose country picker\nEurope\nand\nRest\nof\nWorld\nNorth\nAmerica\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Yves desk is an elegant and compact writing desk, with softly sculpted legs and a tiered top. It has an inlaid dark brown leather writing surface, two drawers and a cable access hole to each side at the rear of the desk. This item requires basic assembly or can be delivered white glove including assembly.\nBlack American walnut\nBlack walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.\nEuropean oak\nEuropean oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.\nDark brown house leather\nOur house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time.\nOiled wood\nAn oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture.\n• Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible.\n• To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out.\n6 monthly replenishment \/ more stubborn stains:\n• As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces\nDo not:\n• Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left)\n• Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain.\nLacquered wood\nA lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth.\nDo not:\n• Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible.\n• Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer.\nHouse leather\nOur house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely.\nDay to day cleaning:\n• As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner.\nDo not:\n• Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.\nThis piece is made in Europe\nYves desk\n£3,900\n£4,510\n£4,510\n£4,510\n£4,510\n£4,510\n£4,250\n£5,150\n£5,150\n£5,150\n£5,150\n£5,150\nIncludes VAT.

We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don’t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently. Therefore if an item has a \"lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular. Feel free however to place an order now as w e also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and\/or lead times are longer than expected.\nPre-Orders:\nWe do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment.  If you would like estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery.\nLead Times:\nCranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed.  We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.\nDelivery:\nWhat we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date.  As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow 7-14 days most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow 2-3 weeks .\nNOTE: For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports.  This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.\nShipping:\nAll items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy\/bulky\/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please contact us . Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available. Orders over $2500 are eligible for free shipping to metro cities (exc TAS & NT). For all orders over $2500 that fall within regional postcodes they will incur an additional delivery charge invoiced after order. Please contact us for a quote prior to order if you would like this confirmed.\nPLEASE NOTE: Delivery is to your post box or front door only.  If you require white glove service of delivery, placement of item and removal of packaging please contact us to arrange.  Additional costs will be incurred.\nStill can't find exactly what you are looking for?  Well let us help you find it!\nYour perfect piece may not even be on our website, but that won't stop us, as our network of partner brands and products extends beyond the products we offer on our online store.\nWe can provide options and a quote with delivery costs, lead times all whilst providing a professional and personal service.

Fine Furniture & Bedding in Jacksonville, Florida\nUse code SAVE25 and enjoy 25% OFF—Limited Time Only!\nUse code SAVE25 and enjoy 25% OFF—Limited Time Only!\nShop By Deparment\nOur Happy Customers\nWe have been customers for over 13 years.  Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service!  We recommend them to all our friends.  Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital.  As always Charlie made it happen!  Great store and great employees!!!!\nCaryl H.\nI have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture.  Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!!\nTammy B.\nI found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors.  Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit.  I would definitely recommend Wayne's!!\nSusanne K.\nBy far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched.\nNick K.\nMy husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5\/5 stars for me\nShaura H.\nI was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother.

For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum’s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor’s Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini.\nInspiration\nHee Welling x HAY Designer talks.

This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.\nINDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.\nOUTDOOR USE\nGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.\nAs with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.\nBecause teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.\nIf you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.\nIf you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.\nTo protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.\nCollections Using Teak"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-06T19:30:56.213905Z","updated_at":"2025-07-06T21:23:26.534366Z","inner_id":47,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":48,"annotations":[{"id":48,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":51,"end":58,"text":"Phantom","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"CCMuoOEqZm","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":363,"end":372,"text":"Bit Stool","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"MDMebuOcPe","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":492,"end":501,"text":"Bit Stool","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"XChJFsu7Vt","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":772,"end":781,"text":"Bit Stool","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"cydtZCALeJ","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-06T21:23:36.944829Z","updated_at":"2025-07-06T21:24:43.772843Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":74.277,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"0231281b-c2ab-4b16-955e-5ae8a777fe58","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":48,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d80d8c99-ls_payload_array.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":"0100","text":"Lamps | Modern lighting for your interior\nLighting\nPhantom\nFødevarestyrelsens smiley-rapporter (Danish Veterinary & Food Administration) Conformity certificates\nGeneral Contact Customer Service Find Dealer Sales Team\nNormann Copenhagen ApS Niels Hemmingsens Gade 12 1153 Copenhagen K Denmark Phone: +45 35 55 44 59 VAT Number DK10008824\nStay up to date and win a Bit Stool\nBe the first to know about new product launches, exclusive offers, inspiration and events, and get the chance to win a Bit Stool every month.\nPrivacy Policy\nThank you for joining our universe!\nYou will now be the first to know about new product launches, exclusive offers, inspiration, events and much more.

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA.\nThis item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.\n+ Counter Height: 15 ¼\" W x 17¼\" D x 32\" H x 26 ½\" H (Seat height) + Bar Height: 15¼\" W x 17 ¼\" D x 34\" H x 29 ½\" H (Seat height) + Weight: 18.60 lbs (counter), 18.80 lbs (bar)\n+ Made to order.

We do not view these marks as defects. Please note that hue and color varies between hides. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each chair. Finish samples available upon request. +  Orders of 3 or more stools may require a freight shipment.  Please inquire with any questions regarding freight deliveries.

This is a beautiful piece of furniture that came assembled and was easy to put up.\nJust what I was looking for, a minimalist and stylish floating TV stand. A unique blend of modern styling and a distressed finish, with clean lines and a nice range of grey and brown tones. It always draws the attention of guests who want to know where I found it. My 1970's walls are not very straight, and that did present some challenges when mounting. The included french cleat mounts are super strong. Be forewarned, the shelves must be installed BEFORE you mount the unit to your wall. They don't fit in from the front. This also means they can't be removed if you decide you don't need them, but they can be adjusted.\nGood quality and something I can mount to the wall. Exactly what I was looking for!\nVery please with my purchase! The floating stand is beautifully made. Very good quality. Definitely purchasing more pieces to add in my home.\nVery high quality and value floating AV cabinet that actually fits a large 36\" center speaker. Install was easy and customer service was very responsive as I was asking questions about the product, etc.\nInformation\nPopular\nRoom\nNews & Updates\nSign up to get the latest on sales, new releases and more…\n© 2025 Woodwaves .\nGet A Coupon!\nSubscribe To Our Newsletter And Get A Coupon For Your First Order"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-06T19:30:56.217814Z","updated_at":"2025-07-07T14:43:03.450949Z","inner_id":73,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":74,"annotations":[{"id":74,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":5,"end":39,"text":"Mid Century Record Storage Console","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"4ABoPicYn3","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5,"end":39,"text":"Mid Century Record Storage Console","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"9lEK3sX4eV","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":93,"end":127,"text":"Mid Century Record Storage Console","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"MD1BDPJpPu","from_name":"ner","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-07T14:57:27.852375Z","updated_at":"2025-07-07T14:57:27.852411Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-07T14:43:27.651996Z","lead_time":863.216,"prediction":{},"result_count":3,"unique_id":"f47281c8-5af3-46b8-8a91-8674bb958e7b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":74,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d80d8c99-ls_payload_array.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":"0160","text":"\n    Mid Century Record Storage Console\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      – JeremiahCollection\n    \n  \nMid Century Record Storage Console\nThis console is perfect for the avid record collector.

Soft yet supportive, this is a chair for every occasion.\nAmount of plain fabric required: 8m The price excludes fabric. For patterned fabric meterage and custom sizes, contact us for advise on quantities and lead times.\nLeg design: Tapered oak leg front, curved leg back\nExtra charges: Skirt: From £200 + VAT Piping or other finishing details: From £100 + VAT\nWe build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back.\nWhere cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring. ​\nWhere castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard.\nWhere legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard.\nAll of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate.\nThe price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know.

For example, item FD-3051T has an \"FD-\" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.\nIf your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, i f the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\nIf you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at 480-962-9930 to ask about the current production time.\nNeed to expedite your order?\nWe're here to help.  Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner.  A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge.\nGood news!  We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (w e have shipped all over the U.S.  W e do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!). We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area.\nThe shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location.  Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at phone number 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote.\nDelivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.\nCustomers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio\/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.\nWith any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways\/tight turns\/low ceilings\/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable.\nIf the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.\nBlanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona) :\nBlanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area.  To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote.  Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area.\nIf your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs . Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is.\nIf you order a platform bed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed.\nIf you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table.  If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly. This may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper.\nPlease note that Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming .
